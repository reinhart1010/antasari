# Antasari Sans
Antasari Sans is a experimental sans-serif typeface project by Reinhart Previano Koentjoro, with characteristics entirely derived from the Reinhart's revised handwriting system in 2015, 2017 and 2018.

The name "Antasari" is derived from [Prince Antasari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Antasari), one of the sultans of Banjarmasin (South Kalimantan, Indonesia), where Reinhart was born.

# System
This typeface is intended to have 2 variants, Display and Text. Unlike Apple's [San Francisco](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/) typeface, these variants have different x-heights.
